Sigil Filter 🔮

A real-time generative vision system that transforms human gestures into evolving sigil-like patterns

🧠 Concept

Sigil Filter is an experimental computer vision project that blends gesture recognition, procedural geometry, and generative art.
Using a webcam feed, the system detects hand movements and dynamically generates sigil-inspired geometric patterns that evolve in real time.

The project explores the intersection of:

Human intent

Motion as input

Symbolic geometry as output

This is not a static filter — the visuals are alive, continuously responding to motion, posture, and spatial relationships between hands.

✨ Features

🎥 Real-time webcam processing

✋ Hand & gesture tracking

🔗 Dynamic, evolving geometric sigils

🌀 Different patterns for different hand states

Open hand → expansive geometry

Closed fist → dense, angular forms

Two hands together → converging / fusion patterns

Energy-ball (Kamehameha-style) pose → centralized sigil construct

🎨 Procedural curves, lines, and vertices (not static overlays)

⚡ Low-latency, continuous visual feedback

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV – video capture & rendering

MediaPipe – hand landmark detection

NumPy – vector & geometry calculations

Math / Trigonometry – procedural pattern generation
